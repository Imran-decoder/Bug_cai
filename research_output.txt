The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. The latest version is the OWASP Top 10 2021. Here are the categories:
1.  **A01:2021-Broken Access Control**: Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.
2.  **A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures**: This category focuses on failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof), which can often lead to the exposure of sensitive data. A common example is when sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card numbers, is not encrypted in transit or at rest.
3.  **A03:2021-Injection**: Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.
4.  **A04:2021-Insecure Design**: This is a new category for 2021, focusing on risks related to design flaws. It calls for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns, and reference architectures.
5.  **A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration**: This moves up from #6 in the previous edition and includes issues like improperly configured cloud services, default accounts and passwords, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.
6.  **A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: This category is for cases where a vulnerable component is used in the application. If you know you are using a vulnerable component, you are opening yourself up to attack.
7.  **A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures**: This was previously "Broken Authentication" and includes weaknesses in session management, credential stuffing, and other authentication-related problems.
8.  **A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures**: This is another new category for 2021, focusing on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity.
9.  **A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: This was previously "Insufficient Logging & Monitoring" and is expanded to include more types of failures. It's crucial for detecting, escalating, and responding to active breaches.
10. **A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: This was added in the 2021 list and occurs when a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).
